# 🛡️ AI-Driven Automated Code Review Assistant

An **AI-powered automated code review system** that detects **security vulnerabilities, unsafe logic flows, and code quality issues** in source code during development and pull requests.

This project combines **static analysis**, **AUG-PDG (Augmented Program Dependence Graphs)**, and a **fine-tuned CodeBERT model**, and integrates seamlessly with **GitHub Actions** to enforce security and quality checks before code is merged.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Multi-Language Support (6 Languages)
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Ruby
- Go

### 🧠 AI-Based Vulnerability Detection
- Fine-tuned **CodeBERT** (`microsoft/codebert-base`)
- Encoder **frozen** for stable logic learning
- Learns **concrete vulnerability flow patterns**

### 🧩 AUG-PDG (Augmented Program Dependence Graph)
- Tracks **SOURCE → SINK → SANITIZATION**
- Enables semantic reasoning beyond regex matching

### 🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Detected
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Unsafe system calls
- Missing input sanitization

### 📐 Static Code Analysis
- Pylint
- Flake8
- Bandit
- Language-specific linters

### 🔁 CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Runs automatically on `push` and `pull_request`

### 📊 Explainable Decisions
- Clear reasoning for **APPROVE / REVIEW / REJECT**

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The vulnerability detection model was evaluated on a held-out test set
containing concrete AUG-PDG patterns.

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Accuracy     | 100%  |
| Precision    | 100%  |
| Recall       | 100%  |
| F1-Score     | 100%  |

> Note: These results reflect performance on **concrete vulnerability flow
patterns** that closely match AUG-PDG extraction output.  
Real-world performance may vary depending on code complexity and language usage.
